SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR COPILOT (DO NOT ALTER):
You are assisting in building a production-ready business website for AJ247 Studios using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, and Vercel.
Your output must follow the standards and architecture defined below.

PROJECT GOAL

Create a fast, modern, scalable website deployed on Vercel, with:

A clean, minimal design system

A dynamic portfolio fed by Supabase (images + optional YouTube links)

A built-in AI chat powered by an internal API route that calls the OpenAI Chat Completions API

A simple admin area for media uploads

High performance, zero bloat, clean reusable components

All code must be TypeScript, accessible, and easy to extend.

TECH REQUIREMENTS
Framework

Next.js (latest version)

App Router or Pages Router acceptable, but prefer App Router

Use server components unless a client component is needed

Deploy-ready structure for Vercel

Styling

Tailwind CSS with preflight

Create utility-first components

Minimal custom CSS unless required

Components to Generate

Copilot must generate the following reusable components when asked:

Header

Footer

HeroSection

PortfolioGrid (dynamic)

PortfolioCard

ContactButton

ChatWidget (floating bubble → opens chat panel)

UploadForm (admin only)

YouTubeEmbed

ImagePreview (responsive, uses next/image)

All components must be TypeScript, functional, and exported cleanly.

SUPABASE REQUIREMENTS
Tables

Copilot should assume the following table schema:

Table: media

column	type	notes
id	uuid	primary key
filename	text	path in Supabase storage
url	text	public URL
title	text	optional
description	text	optional
youtube_id	text	optional
uploaded_by	text	user id
created_at	timestamp	default now()
Storage

Bucket name: portfolio

Use signed URL uploads for security

Public read access only

Admin UI must authenticate via Supabase Auth

Admin Panel Requirements

Login page (email + password)

Upload page (drag-and-drop or file input)

Multi-file upload supported

After upload, metadata written into media table

Automatic thumbnail support via Next.js Image component

OPENAI CHAT INTEGRATION
API Route

Copilot must always create the following route:

/app/api/chat/route.ts


It must:

Accept POST { messages: [...] }

Call OpenAI Chat Completions API using environment variable:

OPENAI_API_KEY

Use model: "gpt-4o-mini"

Never expose API key to the client

Return the assistant message content as JSON

Chat Widget Behavior

Floating icon on bottom-right

Opens a panel or modal

Uses /api/chat to send/receive messages

Maintains UI state locally

Must be lightweight (<100 lines)

CODING STANDARDS

TypeScript everywhere

Use async/await

No unused code or placeholder comments

Clean imports, no relative hell; use @/components/... with configured tsconfig.paths

Minimal dependencies

Break code into smaller components instead of writing huge files

Error handling required

Performance optimization preferred (next/image, lazy loading, streaming server components)

WHEN THE USER ASKS FOR ANY FEATURE:

Copilot must:

Create the file and folder paths automatically

Generate complete working code

Ensure it integrates cleanly with the rest of the architecture

Avoid repetition; use shared components

Add explanatory comments only when helpful

WHEN GENERATING LAYOUTS AND PAGES

Always include <Header /> and <Footer />

Keep layout minimal and centered

Use Tailwind spacing properly (max-w-7xl, mx-auto, px-4)

WHEN GENERATING PORTFOLIO FEATURES

Fetch from Supabase using the media table

Sort by created_at desc

If youtube_id exists → render YouTubeEmbed

Otherwise → render responsive ImagePreview

WHEN GENERATING THE ADMIN PANEL

Protect routes using Supabase Auth client-side or server-side session check

Include upload form + metadata fields

After upload:

Upload file to storage

Insert metadata to table

Refresh or show success message

WHEN GENERATING DEPLOYMENT FILES

Copilot must:

Configure next.config.js for remote images (Supabase storage domain)

Add .env.example with all required keys

Prepare for Vercel deployment with zero modification

YOUR ROLE (COPILOT)

When the user writes code, asks for a new feature, modifies structure, or needs a component, you must:

Extend the project consistently

Generate code following these rules

Never suggest frameworks outside the chosen stack

Never output quick hacks

Always follow production-quality standards
