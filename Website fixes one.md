Nice. You dumped the raw facts — smart move. I turned them into ready-to-paste website content, a change checklist, package edits, and a single “Co-pilot” prompt you can paste to auto-apply everything. I tried to verify the social links but the web check failed (fetch throttled). So I left the links exactly as you gave them — double-check the URLs in your browser and then paste the Co-pilot prompt. Below: precise copy, short bios, gear list, package edits, and the Co-pilot prompt.

# What to update (quick checklist)

1. Contact (phone, email) — footer + Contact page + WhatsApp Business.
2. About page — company blurb + key stats (projects, clients, photos delivered).
3. Team page — add Josiah, Anthony, Szymon (roles + short bios).
4. Gear / Equipment page — list the cameras.
5. Services / Packages — remove makeup artist from included items; add USB-drive media add-on; update pricing/placeholders.
6. Social links — update footer + contact page + blog/portfolio CTAs. (I tried to verify links but web fetch failed — check them yourself.)
7. Portfolio metrics — update numbers for projects delivered / clients / photos delivered (I put placeholders).
8. Add WhatsApp CTA (“Message to book”) linked to your number and the WhatsApp Business description.

# Small UX & copy tips (practical founder stuff)

* Put WhatsApp CTA in the header and footer. It’s your fastest booking channel.
* On About page: add one client testimonial (short). Social proof beats any fluffy paragraph.
* For packages: show a “what’s not included” line — makes removing makeup artist obvious and avoids confusion.
* Use a branded filename convention for delivered files: `CLIENTNAME_DATE_DELIVERABLE_VERSION` — clients love neatness.
